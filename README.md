**Abstract**

The study of the Higgs boson is important to advance frontier physics, however, this requires large experiments that are not so accessible. Therefore, to facilitate its analysis, in this text the Higgs is studied through Monte Carlo simulations delving into two Higgs decay channels: the golden production channel () and a heavy decay to a tau-antitau pair (). Generating relevant statistics with a search range reduction method and ending with algorithms applicable to real collider data.

**Keywords:** Higgs boson, simulation, Monte Carlo, golden channel.

**Introduction**

The Standard Model is a quantum field theory that describes the fundamental particles of the universe and their interactions. Specifically, the model describes and has successfully predicted quarks, leptons, vector bosons, and scalar bosons. The last particle discovered by experiments was the Higgs boson in 2012 at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) thanks to the large hadron collider. The Higgs boson is an important link in the primordial understanding of other particles, since it is related to them through the Higgs mechanism, which provides them with their mass (Oerter, 2006). That is why to find and continue working on frontier physics, the continuous study of all these particles and especially the Higgs boson is necessary.

However, a major impediment to testing the Standard Model and related hypotheses is that enormous amounts of energy, equipment, and human capital are required for the machinery that accelerates beams of protons to collide with each other to function properly, which is not possible. It is accessible all the time; Therefore, taking advantage of the "random" nature of collisions and theory, it is possible to overcome this problem by using computer simulations with Monte Carlo-type event generators to study collisions and their results. Thus, the objective of the research is to analyze the Higgs boson in a hands-on way through these simulations that make it more accessible; obtaining relevant statistics and algorithms applicable to real collider data.

**Development**

_ **Justification** _

When working with simulators, there are many facilities available in the analysis of the resulting data that are not available in real experiments. An obvious advantage is the ability to "detect" particles that are not observable in the collider detectors; For example, in a simulator it is possible to know with complete certainty that a quark was generated in a collision, as well as the energy it carried; on the other hand, quarks are not detectable in a real experiment.

With the above in mind, an immediate problem arises, the Higgs is not detectable and the objective is to generate algorithms applicable to real (detectable) data. However, its analysis is still possible thanks to the fact that it decays into other particles that are (depending on the decay channel) and based on the information collected from these particles, it can be reconstructed and relevant data obtained from it (Spira, 2020). .

_ **Methodology** _

Under this premise, two Higgs decay channels suitable for analysis were selected: the golden decay channel () and a heavy decay to two tau leptons (), see Figure 1 (Contreras-Campana et al., 2012).

The high-energy physics event generator Pythia was selected, using version 3.809 and its default interface in C++ (supported by the user guide by Bierlich et al. (2022)) and the analysis of the data generated by the simulator was made in Python. Specifically, the algorithm performed and the workflow for the analysis is as follows:

1. Initial configuration of the simulator.
  1. Import header files from the simulator.
  2. Proton beam configuration. Make the collision energy 13.6 TeV (highest energy produced at CERN today).
  3. Configure the number and types of events. We worked with two types of configurations: one where the Higgs could decay in any of its decay channels (see Workman et al. (2022)) and another where it only decays to the channel of interest.
2. Event cycle/main cycle.
  1. Particles relevant to the desired decays are filtered; all the decay particles, that is, even the non-detectable ones, are saved in a file to determine the accuracy of the reconstruction of these particles; and in another file only the observable particles.
3. Load generated data into the parser in Python.
4. It will repeat on the falling event.
  1. Classify the type of lepton: electron, muon or tau. Or, their corresponding antiparticles.
5. Determine feasibility.
  1. The boson is reconstructed (or the directly if it is the decay in taus) if certain conditions are met in the event such as that the number of leptons detected is the minimum necessary for the decay channel, the leptons are sufficiently energetic (equal to or greater than 10 GeV) and there are two lepton-antilepton pairs. Being considered first the most energetic lepton and its corresponding antilepton if it exists (also the most energetic of those available).
6. Reconstruction of the Higgs.
  1. Two ranges were studied where the mass of the Higgs was sought: from 100 to 150 GeV and from 124 to 126 GeV. If the Higgs reconstructed by the algorithm from the falls within the range, it is considered valid.
7. Creation of histograms.

_ **Results** _

After executing the algorithm for the aforementioned ranges of 100 to 150 GeV and 124 to 126 GeV and 15,000 events for the gold production channel and 10,000 events for the heavy channel, the histograms in Figures 2 to 4 are finalized.

**Conclusions**

_ **Discussion** _

Using the configuration where the decay was forced only to the channel of interest made it easier to analyze a specific channel and check the correct functioning of the algorithm and subsequently apply it to runs where any type of decay existed to determine the efficiency of said algorithm, with which can also verify the frequency of each decay.

Having reconstructed the bosons from the more energetic boson was due to the assumption that in an event where the Higgs decays, the leptons generated are much more energetic than those generated by other means. However, this is not always the case, since if it were, the histogram entries would correspond entirely to the number of configured events.

The value for filtering leptons of 10 GeV energy or more was purely arbitrary after having experimented with the simulator repeatedly. Future analyzes determining the most appropriate energy threshold may be beneficial for this algorithm.

_ **Contributions** _

It was observed that the method of reducing the search range of the Higss mass ultimately guides the analysis towards the true mass of the Higgs boson. (Workman et al., 2022), suggesting that reducing the range helps eliminate false true reconstructed Higgs, as the standard deviation is reduced.

Ultimately, the objective was achieved by recovering a valuable analysis of the Higgs boson and ending with algorithms applicable to real data from colliders, all this through just two of its lepton decay channels.
